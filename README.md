Copy Stories from Literotica.com. Can copy multiple works and save into a single text file. Right now this is the default operation. All links on the left will be saved as a single file. I plan to fix that so it will only save files that are the same series as a single file. Allowing users to easily select a bunch of url's to download quickly.
